# Little Duck Compiler | C++ Subset Language Compiler

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for a compiler designed for a C++ subset language. This project was developed as part of the Advanced Applications course. The implementation includes a Lexer, Parser, and a simulation of a Virtual Machine, all built using Python and the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files:

- `lex.py` - The lexer implementation for the subset language.
- `main.py` - The main driver program for the compiler.
- `memory.py` - Manages memory for the virtual machine.
- `obj.txt` - Sample object code generated by the compiler.
- `parser.out` - Parser output file.
- `parser.py` - The parser implementation for the subset language.
- `parsetab.py` - Parser table.
- `textEditor.txt` - A sample input file for the compiler.
- `virtualMachine.py` - The virtual machine that executes the compiled code.
- `yacc.py` - The Yacc implementation for parsing.
- `README.md` - This documentation file.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the PLY library, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install ply
```

## Usage
The textEditor.txt file contains code that that will be compiled.

Run the main.py file to compile and execute the subset language code.  




## Supported Constructs

### Program Structure

```cpp
program programName;

var a : int;

main {
    // Statements
}

end
```

### Variable Declarations
```cpp
var a, b: int;
var c: float, d: int;
```

### Print Statements
```cpp
print("Hello, World!");
print(a);
```

### Assignments
```cpp
a = 5;
b = a + 3;
c = 5.5;
```

### Control Flow
###   If-Else Statements
```cpp
if (a < b) {
    // Statements
} else {
    // Statements
};
```

### While Loops
```cpp
while (a > 0) {
    // Statements
};
```

### Do-While Loops
```cpp
do {
    // Statements
} while (a > 0);
```

### Functions
```cpp
void myFunction(a: int) [
  var a, b: int;
  {
    // Statements
  }
    
];
```

### Function Calls
```cpp
myFunction(10);
```
